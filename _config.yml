         I worked as the 2nd shift manager of Outbound Logistics in 2020 and Point of Use in 2021. These were at the warehouse and engine remanufacturing facility respectively. The Outbound Logistics team is expected to pull, packout, stage, and ship material to remanufacturing campus facilities, while Point of Use to inbound, put up, and move material interfacility.

         As a section manager, I engaged in proactive safety through standard work audits, continuous improvement cards, and stop-to-fix incidents for out of process situations; investigated quality defects; communicated timely and effectively; managed manpower flexibility and onboarding; and leveraged my technical background by designing a helpful handtool for the putaway team. I did a lot of stuff every day, but I think the most important was listening to my employees and following up with them about their needs.

         I recently passed a milestone I'm really proud of. I completed ETHx's Self-Driving Cars with Duckietown, an online course in robotics and autonomy.

         I wanted to take this course because I was interested in robotics and computer vision, and this looked like a really great entry. It also included course work in both a simulated and physical robot environment, which is a fun way to learn. This course wasn't easy, as I describe in later sections I learned to creatively problem solve many unfamiliar issues, but it was a guide to a lot of growth throughout.

         With a robot, one of the initial steps is hardware build and test. All of the course material is intended to be foundational for real-life applications, so it's neat to have the physical robot to send around your living room. Here's a photo of me building the robot and it initially only going in circles.

         <div class="image-container20">
           <img src="/images/build_test_1.png" alt="Robot hardware build">
           <img src="/images/build_test_2.png" alt="Robot build motor error">
         </div>

         An SD card reflash fixed the issue, but it was a good precursor to the troubleshooting efforts necessary to do something like this.

         Duckietown is structured on learning theories through short lecture videos on edX and practical applications through a sleek jupyter notebook setup. The course shell is downloaded to your computer, and the environment is controlled with docker containers.

         The first module of the course, towards autonomy, introduces the stateful architecture agent/controller model including the textbook perception, planning, and control modules.  It also includes filtering the camera image by color to find duckie obstacles and use simple motor commands to respond. Image filtration builds into more advanced techniques with the successive modules.

         Modeling and control puts to use all the kinematic equations and odometry I enjoy as an ME, and tops it off with PID controllers. I made sure I understood the differential drive EOMs again, calibrated my robot in this module testing values of gain and trim that provided a good driving experience, and coded a PID controller that set the robot on a given course after starting from an initial offset.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/modcon_1.png" alt="Odometry">
         </div>

         Visual Lane Servoing is where the building begins in camera calibrations and filtering the image stream into useful information for self-driving. Sobel edge detection, Gaussian blur, color gradients, and image masking make for a decent lane detection in well marked road areas. These images I coded using the masking techniques effectively removed most of the outliers.

         <img src="/images/vis_servo_1.png" alt="Image filtration">
         
         Duckietown's model is learning theories and applying at least one of them to a graded simulation. Performance in simulation environments is used as graded markers at the end of each module. This entailed scripting the blank sections of the code on your own and running the simulation to help iterate and improve previous solutions before submissions. Using principles of image filtration, I coded the simulated robot around a small and large loop. As you can see my beginning masks and motor weight matrices were not very good, but they improved with iteration as I honed my color hsv values and motor weights. (mask images don't necessarily align with the loop run below).

         <div class="image-container50">
            <img src="/images/vis_servo_2.png" alt="Masks and loops">
         </div>
         
         A good lesson I learned also, is to know where your simulation environment differs from your real world. In this case the color schemes were pretty far off for white and needed to be tuned.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/vis_servo_3.png" alt="Sim vs real life">
         </div>

         Next, one of the coolest modules-- object detection using deep learning models. I spent a lot of time reading and listening to lectures and youtube videos on advanced visual perception, loss functions, stochastic gradient descent, deep convolutional neural networks, etc. The jupyter notebooks were replaced with Google Colab this time, and I learned what was necessary to define a CNN using PyTorch, which I trained using YoloV5 and subsequently got recall and precision values up to high .8 and .9s respectively.  Here's a photo of my robot finding duckies. I found a few ways to trick it, but it was overall pretty good.

         <div class="image-container33">
            <img src="/images/obj_det_1.png" alt="Duckies in camera view">
            <img src="/images/obj_det_2.png" alt="Duckies in computer vision">
         </div>

         State estimation was the intro into theoretical statistics I didn't know I didn't know. I did go pretty deep into this trying to understand. Doing the heavy lifting upfront in lectures helped immensely when applying the Kalman filter and particle filter to simulated data. Once you use the right symbol for matrix multiplication, you can get a pretty on par Kalman filter estimate.

         <div class="image-container33">
            <img src="/images/state_est_1.png" alt="Kalman trial">
            <img src="/images/state_est_2.png" alt="Kalman success">
         </div>

         Likewise with the particle filter.

         <div class="image-container33">
            <img src="/images/state_est_3.png" alt="Particle filter dot graph">
            <img src="/images/state_est_4.png" alt="Particle filter line graph">
         </div>

         The histogram filter part of this module was a bit more difficult. The graded sim for the State Estimation module was a successful lane following run using a histogram filter localization approximation. You use the edges the camera detects from the lane markers to approximate your location. The loop this time was a more advanced track of twists and turns. The sim was evaluated by three attempts at the loop with different starting positions and directions. My first attempts were not amazing, veering off track and spiraling.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/state_est_6.png" alt="hist filter second attempt">
           <img src="/images/state_est_7.png" alt="hist filter third attempt">
         </div>

         Ignoring the spirals, I wanted to figure out why my robot deviated so far outside of the center of the lane. With a bit of sleuthing, I figured out there was a significant amount of yellow color being detected in the grass. This is important because my robot localizes itself by generating a vote on where it thinks it is based off of each color and edge detection of the lane markers, which there showed to be a lot of the yellow ones where there shouldn't have been.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/state_est_8.png" alt="Measurement likelihood lecture">
         </div>

         In filtering out the grass color and honing the code further, my ability to stay in the center of the lane improved. I was however, still spiraling at some point.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/state_est_9.png" alt="Hist filter out grass 1">
           <img src="/images/state_est_10.png" alt="Hist filter out grass 2">
         </div>

         After some trial and error on why my code was breaking, I realized I was facing a division error as I updated and normalized my belief and the denominator approached zero. I added an if statement to handle the error, and my robot and I were almost making full loops immediately.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/state_est_11.png" alt="The worst hist loops youve ever seen">
         </div>

         Kidding, I'm not sure what exactly happened here, though I think it had to do with something not setting up right in the simulation. A rerun gave a much smoother result. Additional shifting in my approach to propagating the centroids of where the new mass should be, or finding the new location vote from the histogram filter in the update stage, got me to some pretty solid runs.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/state_est_13.png" alt="Hist lane following even smoother">
           <img src="/images/state_est_14.png" alt="Hist lane following smoothest">
         </div>

         The last modules introduce collision detection and path planning algorithms. Collision detection required a True/False statement on if static instances of a robot collided with its environment. I did pretty well approximating everything as a circle, but went for the true win branching out and using the separating axis theorem. Once I got my corner calculations sorted, victory was certain.

         <div class="image-container50">
           <img src="/images/coll_det_1.png" alt="Approx as circle collision detection">
           <img src="/images/coll_det_2.png" alt="No wrong answers using SAT">
         </div>

         Path planning was an intro into graph search and shortest path algorithms, including a code challenge using networkX. Reinforcement learning lectures building off of object detection closed out the class.

         In summary, this was one of the most technically challenging, in-depth attempts I've made at a project using the basis of what I learned in college. Both putting in the time to understand the lectures and math as well as the code and unintentional learning curve items like Linux, ROS, Github, and using the terminal interface, I feel I'm now in a world where pushing the boundaries of what technology can do for us seems a little less daunting.
