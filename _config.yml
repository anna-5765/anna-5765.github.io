   Hi, my name's Anna and I'm a Mechanical Engineer. Most recently I've taken an interest in robotics & autonomy, working through the Duckietown curriculum of self-driving vehicles. I like programming, hands-on engineering and test, and learning something new.

# I have also worked in process engineering from line-side support, capital projects, data analytics, to management. Throughout my career I've gained skills including design, test, computer programming, teamwork, and leadership. 

# I am most skilled in: <mark>Skill1</mark> and <mark>Skill2</mark>

         In the New Product Introduction Coordinator role, I facilitated proactive Manufacturing Risk Evaluations and Process Failure Mode and Effects Analysis risk assessments across all large engine platforms in both machining & assembly. I led a culture change toward improving the caliber of proactive risk identification & mitigation. We developed over 500 proactive quality recommended actions over 10+ major PFMEA assessments including new engine configurations and new machines. I also delivered gateway review information in presentations to update Engineering and Product Managers of program statuses relative to manufacturing quality and build readiness. To add in a bit more technical, hands-on work, I did a cleanliness test project for a new insourced engine housing.

         My final rotation, one all program participants need to complete, was a Section Manager position. I worked as the 2nd shift manager of Outbound Logistics in 2020 and Point of Use in 2021. These were at the Corinth Logistics Warehouse and Corinth Production Plant respectively for Caterpillar Remanufacturing. The Outbound Logistics team is expected to pull, packout, stage, and ship material to Mississippi Campus facilities, while Point of Use to inbound, put up, and move material interfacility. I engaged in proactive safety through standard work audits, continuous improvement cards, and stop-to-fix incidents for out of process situations; investigated quality defects; communicated timely and effectively; managed manpower flexibility and onboarding; and tried to leverage my technical background by designing a helpful handtool for the putaway team. I did a lot of stuff every day, but I think the most important was listening to my employees and following up with them about their needs.

           LTDP 2: Manufacturing Engineer 
        caption: July 2019 - July 2020
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
         Second in my rotations with Caterpillar, I completed what would be my favorite position as a Manufacturing Engineer at the Menominee Coupling Facility. I went from not knowing what a coupling was, to installing new semi-automatic assembly machines, to acting as line-side troubleshooting support for said machines (especially while they inevitably broke during their initial run phase), to running 3 more capital projects in machining. At a small facility, I had the opportunity to work on diverse projects: I completed projects with EHS upgrading the chemical storage area, did part cost analyses with Finance, worked through shipping logistics of a new machine with Supply Chain (during the middle of Covid no less), and was given action items to work through for our Six Sigma projects.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
         This was my first position out of college and first rotation in the Leadership and Technical Development Program. I enjoyed a variety of projects in a variety of different realms under Operations Quality at the Large Engine Center. While working in Supplier Quality, I created a webtool they still use today that crunches risk numbers based on leading indicators of a supplier part nonconformance, and aids in routing material through receiving inspection before being accepted into official Cat inventory. Within Internal Quality, I ran a machine shop metrology strategy project on the 3500 rod line, auditing and improving feature gauging details and data collection. Within Out-Plant Quality, I added 2 additional quality gates on the 3600 line through analyzing defect per unit data and ensuring the gate location in a close feedback loop relative to defect cause area.

          Self-Driving Cars with Duckietown is a robotics and AI Massive Open Online Course hosted on edX, an online learning platform.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I started this course as a way of improving my technical repertoire and learning about robotics and programming. Through an intense learning approach, I gained experience with professional tools and workflows used in modern robotics such as:
          - <mark>Linux</mark> 
          - Terminal interfaces
          - <mark>ROS</mark> 
          - <mark>Python</mark>
          - Computer vision & training <mark>Convolutional neural networks</mark>
          - <mark>GitHub</mark>
          - Incrementally developing solutions 
          - Creative troubleshooting
          - Testing solutions in simulation before the real world

          I also interacted with the community of peer learners and the staff on the course Slack and Stack Overflow. This includes asking for help and supporting others in answering peer questions.

          During my time at Purdue I learned key skills that have I have taken through my career such as dedication, an intuition to how the science of the world works, and a curiosity to creativly problem-solve. I thouroughly enjoyed my time at university.

          I spent a lot of my free time working on the Purdue Utility Project global development team, advocating for student involvement in global engineering experiences as an Ambassador for Global Engineering Programs, and staying involved with other outreach organizations such as volunteering for Purdue Space Day, Introduce a Girl to Engineering, and Women in Engineering.

      In 2023-2024 I took some time to pursue personal interests in life & career. Check out Duckietown in my projects section to learn more about my delve into robotics & autonomy.

      I also spent some time off-grid in the British Virgin Islands. I enjoy sailing and learning about boat systems, here are some photos of the adventure.
